# BAS-Versions

Ben's Amazing Softwares Versions is a lightweight versionning tool for any kind of project.
Basically it creates 'checkpoints' folders and stores a backup of your project files.
You can defin filters for filenames you want to include/exclude in the checkpoint. The soft then checks Last Modified dates and comes up with a list of files to backup for you.
It features previews of the filtered file tree and modified filtered files.

BasVersions is a project I started to learn more Java, it's really not intented to be any kind of revolution but it might help you.
